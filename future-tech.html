      <p>The future of technology promises a fusion of human creativity and machine precision. From AI-driven innovation to quantum computing, emerging technologies are transforming every aspect of life and industry.</p>

      <h3>1. Artificial Intelligence Everywhere</h3>
      <p>AI will become as common as electricity — embedded into devices, tools, and even homes. Predictive systems will handle complex decisions in real-time, improving efficiency and convenience.</p>

      <h3>2. Quantum Computing</h3>
      <p>Quantum computers are poised to solve problems far beyond classical machines — from drug discovery to secure encryption. Major companies like IBM and Google are racing to achieve “quantum advantage.”</p>

      <h3>3. Space and Green Tech</h3>
      <p>Space exploration and clean energy tech are merging into a new era of sustainability. Solar farms in orbit and space mining may soon be viable industries.</p>

      <h3>4. Smart Cities & IoT</h3>
      <p>With interconnected systems, cities will become more efficient, using real-time data to manage traffic, energy use, and safety — enhancing urban living.</p>

      <h3>The Road Ahead</h3>
      <p>The line between digital and physical will continue to blur. Future tech will focus on sustainability, accessibility, and human collaboration, driving innovation that benefits all.</p>
