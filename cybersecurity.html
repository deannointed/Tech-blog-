      <p>Introduction <br>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, networks, data, and digital systems from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage. In our modern world, where almost everything is connected online — from personal devices to global business systems — cybersecurity has become one of the most important fields in technology.</p>
      
      <p>What Cybersecurity Means <br>At its core, cybersecurity is about keeping information safe. It ensures that the data we send, receive, and store remains private and trustworthy. This includes everything from your social media accounts and online banking to the servers that power governments and large corporations. Cybersecurity involves a mix of technology, processes, and people working together to reduce risks and stop harmful activities before they cause serious problems.</p>

      <p>Main Areas of Cybersecurity
        <ol>
            <li>Network Security: Protects systems and data as they travel across networks.</li>
            <li>Information Security: Focuses on keeping data private and unaltered.</li>
            <li>Application Security: Ensures software and apps are designed to resist attacks.</li>
            <li>Cloud Security: Protects data and systems stored on cloud platforms.</li>
            <li>Operational Security: Deals with how organizations handle and protect data in daily activities.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      
      <p>Why Cybersecurity Matters <br>Every day, billions of online activities take place — from simple text messages to large-scale financial transactions. Without cybersecurity, this digital world would be chaotic and unsafe.Cybersecurity helps:
      <ul>
        <li>Protect personal and financial information</li>
        <li>Maintain trust in digital systems</li>
        <li>Prevent business disruptions</li>
        <li>Safeguard national security and infrastructure</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      <p>Everyday Cyber Safety Tips
      <ol>
        <li>Use strong, unique passwords for each account</li>
        <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)</li>
        <li>Keep devices and software updated</li>
        <li>Avoid suspicious links or emails</li>
        <li>Regularly back up important data</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

      <p>These small steps can make a big difference in keeping your online identity secure.</p>

      <p>The Evolving World of Cybersecurity <br>Cybersecurity is constantly changing. As technology advances, new tools like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and blockchain are being used to strengthen defense systems. However, as defenses improve, cybercriminals also find new methods of attack — making cybersecurity an ongoing challenge that requires awareness and innovation.</p>

      <p>Conclusion <br>Cybersecurity is not just a concern for tech experts — it affects everyone who uses the internet. From individuals to global organizations, protecting digital information is a shared responsibility. By understanding the basics of cybersecurity and practicing safe online habits, we can all play a role in creating a safer digital world.</p>
