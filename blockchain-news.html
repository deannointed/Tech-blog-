      <h1>The Decentralized Revolution</h1>

      <p>Blockchain technology has evolved from a buzzword into one of the most transformative innovations of the 21st century. Initially designed to power Bitcoin, it now fuels applications beyond finance — from supply chains to voting systems.</p>

      <h3>Understanding Blockchain</h3>
      <p>At its core, blockchain is a digital ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent way. Because it’s decentralized, no single entity controls the network, making it resilient to manipulation and fraud.</p>

      <h3>Use Cases Beyond Cryptocurrency</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Healthcare:</b> Patient data can be securely stored and shared between hospitals.</li>
        <li><b>Supply Chains:</b> Companies like IBM and Walmart use blockchain to trace goods.</li>
        <li><b>Digital Identity:</b> Blockchain provides tamper-proof ID systems for citizens.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Cryptocurrency Today</h3>
      <p>Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum remain volatile, but adoption is growing. Governments are experimenting with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), and businesses increasingly accept crypto payments.</p>

      <h3>Challenges Ahead</h3>
      <p>Scalability, regulation, and environmental impact are key issues. However, innovations like proof-of-stake and layer-2 scaling solutions are making blockchain faster and greener.</p>

      <h3>The Future</h3>
      <p>Experts predict that blockchain will soon underpin global data integrity. As decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts mature, the world may finally move toward a more transparent and inclusive digital economy.</p>
