      <p>Robotics is redefining the boundaries of automation and innovation. From industrial robots to personal assistants, machines are taking on more roles than ever — enhancing efficiency, precision, and safety.</p>

      <h3>Industrial Automation</h3>
      <p>In manufacturing, robots perform complex tasks with high accuracy. Companies like Tesla and Toyota use robotic systems to streamline production while reducing human error.</p>

      <h3>Service and Medical Robots</h3>
      <p>Robots are increasingly being used in hospitals, warehouses, and even homes. Surgical robots perform delicate operations, while service bots assist in cleaning, deliveries, and eldercare.</p>

      <h3>AI-Powered Robotics</h3>
      <p>Artificial intelligence enables robots to learn from their environment. This synergy between AI and robotics is creating adaptive systems capable of decision-making and problem-solving.</p>

      <h3>The Human-Robot Partnership</h3>
      <p>Future robotics won’t aim to replace humans, but to collaborate. From education to exploration, robots will become valuable teammates that expand human potential.</p>
